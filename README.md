# Mobile-Architecture

This project revolved around an Inventory Application. It was defined to address many user needs such as logging in/creating a new user, displaying current inventory and  adding/deleting editing items. The app also features SMS permission notifications.

The application involved a login screen for loggin in, the inventory screen for displaying the current inventory items, the item page, as well as a page for adding a new item and editing a current one. The UI design is simple and easy to use to ensure the user can effectively use the app while
completing their necessary jobsite tasks. The simplicity and responsiveness of the UI is what would attract users.

When approaching the coding of the application, it helped out a lot ot have the UI layout mostly finished beforehand. This made it easier to focus on the functionality of the app instead of going back and forth. It also helped with ensuring the idea I had for the UI was clear and simple.

In testing my code, I used the Android Studio device emulator. Throughout the development process, I used this every step of the way to ensure everything worked as intended before moving on to the next step. Using the emulator to test helped me remove any errors or warnings that could cause issues.

One challenge I faced with the app was the structure of the editing of an item. I went back and forth deciding how I wanted to implement editing into the program but I believe I chose the most intuitive way for users to easily edit their current items.

Overall, the application itself easily allows users to manage their inventory, but the specific component I was most successful in demonstrating was the database connections. I was able to successfully implement this for the user logins and the inventory items.
